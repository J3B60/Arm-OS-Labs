# Arm-OS-Labs
Coursework focused on looking at Linux Commands, C compilers, Shell programming, System Calls, Pipes and Forks, Inter-Process Communication and Memory Management in Operating Systems specifically in Linux on an Arm processor.

## Linux Commands
These are some of the Linux commands covered:
- whoami
- strace
- man
- sh
- gpp/gcc

## Shell Programming
Code exercises found in the repository:
- myage: takes the users input and outputs their age only if it is less than 30.

## System Calls
- getpid
- getppid
- program that can identify itself and print parent and child ID for respective process.

## Pipes and Forks
- Track Pipes and Forks of a program using Strace.
- Making Pipelines (linux comand pipe and also via C program to compare the two cases).
- Process CPU usage.
- Using POSIX threads instead of forks and compare.
- Mutual Exclusion semaphore in POSIX threaded program.

## Inter-Process Communication
- Program for sending messages marked by groups.
- Signal Handlers.
- Trace messages using Strace trace=signal.

## Memory Management
- A program to output memory page numbers and offset for a given address with page size set to 1MB.
- Splitting data into chunks.
